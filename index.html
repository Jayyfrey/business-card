        <h2 class="center">About Me</h2>
          <p class="center">I have many interests that make up who I am. I enjoy coding, organizing, puzzles, video games, movies, and any good group activities. While I am new to coding and Software Engineering, I am extatic to learn this new language and put it to use every day for the rest of my life. With each day I learn code, I realize that it is something that really grabs me and pulls me in. From trying to manipulate old computer games to creating my own webpages, I have come a long way.</p>
          <p class="center">As I excitedly share the things I am learning with my wife, it is clear that I need to find others that share my passion and speak my new language. I love my wife, but she does not share my enthusiasm. Speaking of my wife, I would like to share a few things about my life. I have a beautiful wife named Chelsie, and two beautiful children named Leo and Kiera. I have a specific priority I would like to share:</p>
          <ol class="center">
            <li>Family</li>
            <li>Career</li>
          </ol>
          <!-- Getting the order and unordered lists to be centered took some extra work and I had to look online. I am happy they are working now. -->
            <p class="center">As much as I love my new career, I think it is improtant to note that everything I do, I do for my family. They are my world, and my work provides for them. I am just glad I enjoy my work too.</p>
